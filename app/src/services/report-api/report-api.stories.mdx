# Report API Service

This module provides services/utilities for interacting with our Report API.
The main tool you'll use in the project is the `ReportAPI` class which allows
you to make requests to that GraphQL API. Additionally, you can access the
`ReportAPI` service in your components using the `useReportAPI` hook.
