import AssetsMeta, { IconGallery, StyledExample } from './Assets.stories.native'

# Icons

The following icons are available from `~/assets`. All icons are `styled-components`
with `styled-system` attributes connected to our theme.

Unfortunately, due to the way the components are dynamically
generated, you must reference the components on the `Icons` export as follows:

```js
import { Icons } from '~/assets'
;<Icons.Calendar />

// The following will not work:
import { Calendar } from '~/assets'
;<Calendar />
```

> NOTE: Some `styled-system` properties such as `padding` only work on web so you should
> test your styling on both native and web to ensure the icons function as you expect.

<Story name="Icons">{IconGallery.bind({})}</Story>

<ArgsTable story="Icons" />

## Styled Example

The following example shows many of the styled system attributes in action.
You can compare this version to the one shown in `yarn storybook:native` to
see which attributes only work on web.

<Story name="Styled Example" args={StyledExample.args}>
  {StyledExample.bind({})}
</Story>

## Adding New Icons

1. To add new icons, simply add the `.svg` file into the `assets/images/icons` folder.
2. Replace the main foreground colors in the SVG file with
   the value ["currentColor"](https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/).
3. Run `yarn build:icons`. This will generate a new icon component in the
   `assets/images/icons/components` folder for you and make it available on the
   `Icons` object.
4. Commit the `.svg` file and the SVG component in the `icons/components` folder.
   Committing these files allows us to further customize those components if we need to.

### Re-generating Existing Icons

If an icon already exists in the `icons/components` folder, `yarn build:icons` will not touch it
in case there are customizations in that file. To regenerate one of those icons,
you'll need to remove the associated component file and re-run `yarn build:icons`.

## Customizing Icons

There are multiple ways you can customize our icons other than through props.

### Customize The SVGs

You may need to customize the `.svg` files you receive from designers before
generating the SVG components. This is the preferred place to make changes to
the SVG data.

### Customize Icon Default Props

To set the default props (ex default color) for a specific icon, you can add
those to the `defaults` object defined in `assets/images/icons/styled.ts`.
You can define any props of the icon there.

```js
const defaults = {
  Application: {
    color: 'brandOrange'
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
    // etc.
  },
}
```

### Component Customizations

If you need to customize more than just the default prop values, you can
write a custom definition for the icon and attach it to the `Icons` object
exported from `assets/images/icons/styled.ts`. This allows you write a fully
custom component but then access it in the same manner as all other icon components.

```jsx
// inside icons/styled.ts
const Icons = {} // Find this definition in the file

// Attach your icon component to the Icons object so it gets exported.
Icons.MyIcon = (props) => {
  // You can write any custom component logic here,
  // including using styled-components or styled-system.
}
```

### Customized SVG Component

All icon components should be committed after they are generated. This means
you can customize the SVG component in the `icons/components` directory and
commit those changes should you need to. It is preferred that you customize
the underlying SVG file as a first option so your changes aren't lost if
the SVG components are recreated.

However, you may sometimes need to customize the SVGs to do things like take
multiple color props, in which case customizing the SVG component is the way to go.
